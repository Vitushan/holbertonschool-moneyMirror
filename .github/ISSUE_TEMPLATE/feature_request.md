## 💡 Feature Summary

Implement full budget management (CRUD) for incomes and expenses, with advanced data visualization and export options.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Users need to track, analyze, and manage their finances easily. This feature enables adding, editing, deleting, and filtering transactions, plus visualizing data for better financial decisions.

## 💻 Proposed Solution

- Add, edit, and delete income/expense transactions (CRUD)
- Search and filter transaction history
- Visualize data: line chart (finance evolution), pie chart (category breakdown), bar chart (period/category comparison)
- Export charts as PNG (one click)
- Display random financial tips and motivational messages
- Secure authentication (NextAuth.js, bcrypt)

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

- Manual spreadsheet management (less user-friendly)
- Third-party apps (less control, privacy concerns)
→ Native, integrated solution is best for UX and security.

- [ ] Charts update in real time
- [ ] User can export charts as PNG
